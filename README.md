Milestone 0 Version 01 Source Code Tic Tac Toe Demo

Server runs on my vm. Address to vm is dynamically linked.
(since this is public, I'll give you the address name)
I run two java jar servers, with different ports.
To play in game 1 (server 01) run 
java -jar [diretory/to/]clienttictactoe01.jar [servername]

1) ensure gif files are in same directory as client jar file
2) ensure java is latest version
3) ensure server is running
4) once there are two clients the game starts
5) ensure you have/know the port number

Adding messaging second swing window opens.
